      If you need help with installing the theme or installing a client mod, this is not the place to ask.
      Use the client mods respective server to ask.

      Before submitting a bug report, please make sure you have read this *entire* form, and that:
      * You have read the README and it has not answered your question
      * Your bug is not caused by any custom CSS or plugins you have installed.
      * Your issue has not been reported before, [make sure to use the search function!](https://github.com/Slddev/SpotiCord/issues)

      **Do not forget to give your issue a descriptive title.** "Bug in the instance screen" makes it hard to distinguish issues at a glance.
